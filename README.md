# Offline-Speech-Recognition-TensorflowLite
An application of on-device speech recognition using a tensorflow speech recognition model converted to tensorflow lite models small enough to run in an ESP32 microcontroller.
This particualar project was designed to control a tiny robot using speech commands like "stop" "left" and "right". The model was converted to C++ objects so it would be debugged into an ESP32 controller.
